fushi/FizzBuzz
==============
FizzBuzz is all the rage these days, and I figured that I should put my versions up.

### Installation
There's nothing to install. Pull the repository, build the source (if applicable), and run the programs.

### Usage
Each version of fushi/FizzBuzz is in a folder labelling what language it was written in. Invocation will vary by language, but will generally be in the form of "fizzbuzz n", where N is the number to stop the game at.

### Contributing
There's not really much to contribute to, but feel free to make a pull request or write up an issue if you feel compelled.'
